# sundial
Code for making sundial patterns, using pyephem

This is source code that can be used for making sundial patterns, such as the
one below.  The figure 8s are analemmas, which show where the sun is at the same
time every day over the course of a year.  Different rainbow colored analemmas
correspond to different hours.  The path of the sun every day is in
the direction of the dashed gray lines. 

Different locations on the Earth have different patterns.  The plot below is for
the location of the flag pole near the Statue of Liberty.
